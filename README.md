# Tomosulo-Algorithm-Implementation in C++
The input of the instruction should be given in binary format(Instruction number,source,destination) and the output is the number of clock cycles taken(for Issue,fetch and decode) for implementing Tomasulo Algorithm.
We can also get each clock cycle information.
